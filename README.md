# [[hyperlink blocked]]

This is a tool I am making to make it easier to edit Deltarune Save Files. <br>
People want me to name it "[[hyperlink blocked]]" <br>
This is very very very unfinished.<br>
I finally got the list box working.<br>
So my antivirus yells at me for trying to make a release build so just build it yourself.<br>

Plans for when I get the "main thing" done:<br>
Thrash Editor<br>
Vessle Editor<br>
Random button for fun. :)
