# [[hyperlink blocked]] v0.0 - A Deltarune Save Editor 

# This was just an experiment and is no longer maintained, 
# please use https://saveeditor.spamton.com instead.

This is a tool I am making to make it easier to edit Deltarune Save Files. <br>
People want me to name it "[[hyperlink blocked]]" <br>
This is very very very unfinished.<br>
Right now, it is only compatible with chapter 2, but I am planing to make it compatible with chapter 1.<br>
So my antivirus yells at me for trying to make a release build so just build it yourself.<br>
I have not really been working on this anymore. <br>
Also use the code if you want as long as you don't steal the entire thing lol.<br>

Plans for when I get the "main thing" done:<br>
Thrash Editor<br>
Gonner Editor<br>
Random button for fun. :)<br>
